Installing MTUQ on chinook
--------------------------

To install MTUQ on chinook, clone the mtuq_install_scripts repository and run 
chinook/install.bash. If all goes well, a virtual environment will be created 
that can be used during the current session and any subsequent sessions. The
virtual environment will be "editable", which means that anytime changes are 
made to the MTUQ source code, they go into effect immediately without having 
to reinstall anything.


NOTES 

- This installation script uses virtualenv, which is incompatible with 
conda. If conda executables are found on the system path, installation will
abort. On chinook, an advantage of virtualenv over conda is that there is less 
potential for conflict with the "toolchains" provided by the system
administrators.

- It is best to run this script from a clean starting environment.  If the
script fails, try `module purge` and rerun `install.bash`.

- For creating figures, MTUQ automatically uses Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) 
executables if present on the system path.  Otherwise, MTUQ will fall back to 
ObsPy, which has known beachball plotting bugs.  We urge users to install
GMT version 6.0.1 or greater.  Currently, GMT installation is not carried out
by this script, and so must be performed manually.




Activating the MTUQ virtual environment
---------------------------------------

At the beginning of a session, users must activate the virtual environment:

   > source activate.bash

At the end of a session, it is a good idea to deactivate the environment:

   > deactivate



Running the examples
--------------------

After activating the virtual environment, users can run either the serial
or parallel examples located in `mtuq/examples/`.  These examples reproduce 
results from Silwal2016.


The serial example can be invoked directly:

    > python mtuq/examples/SerialGridSearch.DoubleCouple.py


The parallel examples can be invoked using the included sbatch wrapper, e.g.:

    > sbatch submit.bash mtuq/examples/GridSearch.DoubleCouple.py



Modifying the examples
----------------------

To obtain moment tensor estimates for events other than the main Silwal2016 
event, users can download waveforms using uafgeotools/pysep and modify the MTUQ
examples as follows:

- Change `path_data` to the pysep download directory

- Change `path_weights` to the CAP-style weight file included with the pysep
 download

- Change the `magnitude` keyword arguments to the desired value for the
current event, or to the desired list of magnitudes if you wish to include
magnitude as a search parameter

- Optionally, adjust the Earth model, data processing and misfit settings.
(Default choices match Silwal2016.)
